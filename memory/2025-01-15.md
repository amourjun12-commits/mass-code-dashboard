# 2025-01-15 - Meeting Bigo

## Context Received

Bigo shared his full **Alchemy of Self** manifesto — a deep, raw self-assessment covering:
- Origin story (Africa, middle-class scarcity, scholarship to Russia)
- Core drivers (money = safety/respect, physique = armor, status sensitivity as fuel)
- Superpowers (belief → action → results, speed, resilience)
- Traps (procrastination, path-switching, ego, self-disqualification, isolation)
- Dream life in Dubai ($10M+ net worth, mentor African men, construction projects, supercars, family rhythm)
- Role models (Iman Gadzi, Brandon Carter, Simeon Panda)
- The gap: moving from reactive/validation-seeking to daily standards + identity alignment

## Key Takeaways

- **Age:** 25, married, living in Bali (for now)
- **Income:** ~$50k/year freelance, aiming for $15k+/month online
- **Vision:** Dubai life, $230-300k/month, mentor + builder
- **Current challenges:** Sleep disrupted by night calls, no closed workspace, small circle, misaligned business
- **Contract to self:** Signed commitment to transformation — 90-day focus, deep work blocks, protected sleep, one vehicle

## What I Did

- Read the full manifesto (long, but necessary — this is who I'm serving)
- Updated **USER.md** with the essentials
- Created this memory file to anchor the context

## Next Steps

- Help Bigo close the gap through daily accountability and pattern calls
- Support one-vehicle commitment and focus protection
- Challenge self-disqualification and ego traps
- Track progress on key metrics (habits, finance, deep work)

This is the foundation. Let's build.
